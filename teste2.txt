NASA  has  an  ambitious  plan  for  space  exploration in the next century. It envisions a scenario in which spacecraft will have revolutionary new capabilities compared to those of today. Spacecraft are envisioned as flying in formation, or  in  fleets,  or  having  artificial  intelligence  to provide  the  kind  of  capability  that  can  answer the  more  detailed  level  of  questions  that  scientists have about the universe.
